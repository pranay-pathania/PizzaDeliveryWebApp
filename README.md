# Pizza Delivery App (React Typescript, NodeJS, MongoDB)

This is one project that i plan to work on for a longer duration than a few weeks. More changes to the app will come soon.
This is something like version 1.0.0 (much less sophisticated though).

---

### Introduction

This is a web application made for an imaginary Pizza Delivery Service (because everyone loves pizza).
It has three major parts as of now:
1. The app a customer interacts with (served on a server completely dedicated to serving static files: temporary replacement to hosting)
2. The app the working staff interacts with (server on the same type of server as above)
3. A dedicated backend for handling requests from both the staff and the customer

---

### Technology Used
1. React Typescript for the UI
2. NodeJS + Express for the backends
3. MongoDB (run locally by running the "mongod" command in the terminal) for the database

---

### Shortcomings of the current project
1. Passwords recieved are not encrypted in any manner before storage.
2. Login implementation is probably a bit lousy and too insecure for the real world.
3. My CSS is terrible (and not responsive)

---

### Takeaways for future projects   
1. Add better styling (and make it responsive, hopefully)
2. Encrypted passwords (very important)
3. Send the user an email telling them that the order has been placed succesfully

### Credits 
1. Pizza names and pictures have been taken from [Dominos India](https://www.dominos.co.in/). 
2. Reviews in the slider on reviews page have been taken from [reviews on Consumer Affairs](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/food/dominos.html)
3. The company name has been taken from [this website](https://businessnamegenerator.com/pizza-business-name-generator-guide-ideas/)

#### Personal Points
1. TS is a bit weird to work with, especially while using React Hooks, but that autocomplete makes up for everything (somewhat).
2. Learn to style your websites better.
